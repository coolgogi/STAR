# STAR : Simple TAR-like file archiving program

## Overview
This task asks you to construct __star__, a simplified version of a file-archiving program __tar__.  
__star__ provides two functionalities.  
First, it generates a file that aggregates all files in a specified directory (i.e., archive).  
Second, for a given archive file generated by itself, star restores all files with their original file names (i.e., extract).  

## Background
As first step, you need to review the basics of file and file system interfaces.  
Read each of the given C library reference pages and solve the associated problems.  

### (1) Read and write a file as binary (not as text)

+ __fread()__ : <http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/fread/>  
+ __fwrite()__ : <http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/cstdio/fwrite/>  
+ What's the other file interfaces that read and write a file as text?  
+ How accessing a file as binary is defferent from accessing it as text?  
+ Write a program that shows each byte of a given file as a hexadecimal number(like xxd does)  

### (2) Accessing a directory
+ Opening a directory  <https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Opening-a-Directory.html>
+ Reading a directroy  <https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Reading_002fClosing-Directory.html>
